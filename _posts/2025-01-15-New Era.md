## A New Chapter Begins

It's early 2025, and we've just turned 24. The milestones we once dreamed of have materialized: a mortgage, a wedding ring, a stable career, and a reasonably fit lifestyle.

We've hit a checkpoint, more or less everything that we dreamed of at 15 we're managed to make on good time - but I find myself sitting in front of the computer, staring at pixelated static. 

I no longer have very clear defined goals that I needed to hit, so we'll sit here - trying for find the next thing to work towards.

Remember how we used to approach video games? We'd scour guides and follow trending strategies, experimenting to find our path to success. 

That's what I'm doing here, nothing is more boring than being still, so this will be the blog where I dump everything I learn and pick up - see what sticks and works
